	<h1>Information About Boeing 787</h1>

	<h2>Short History</h2>

	<p>The Boeing 787 is Boeing's newest twin engine jet. Development started in 2002 when Boeing decided to manufacture a new aircraft with greater fuel efficency. The first test flight happended in 2009. It finally launched and had its first passenger flight in 2011. However, this sucess was short livid. In 2013, safety problems with the plane's battery and structure cause the plane to be grounded. The plane's lithium-ion batterys would catch fire in flight, causing the planes to have to land. The issue has still not been fully resolved, but necessary safety measures have been put into place and the plane is flying again.  </p>

	<h2>What makes it one of the most modern planes?</h2>
	<p>The Boeing 787 is one of the most mdoern and technologically advanced planes in the sky today. The plane is extremely fuel efficent due to its carbon fiber body. This makes the plane lighter than traditional aluminium aircraft which in turn makes it more fuel efficent. The Boeing 787 also has state of the art computers and navigational systems. The interior of the plane cabin also has many features that make it one of the most comfortable planes to fly in. This includes pressurizing the plane at a lower altitude, electronic window shades, adaptive led lighting, and automated flight smoothing from turbulance.
